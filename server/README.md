# REST server
A Python REST server for debugging REST APIs.

## Proposal
I am new to REST APIs so I need a way of playing with them and debugging. This will be a REST server made following the [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Once this is useable, I might convert it to a Python package using my [Python Template](https://github.com/TR33HGR/python-template).
